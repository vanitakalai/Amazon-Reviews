    "<b>People are increasingly using social media to disseminate their views on products they have purchased and companies do not have a structured way of extracting this data and analysing it for sentiment. Most companies still rely on reviews being written to them or posted to their page to understand the impact of their product. This tends to be a small sample size and there are now many labelled datasets which can be used to train an in-house sentiment analysis tool for unlabelled data. In this case, we will be creating a tool for a client selling electronic products using the Amazon electronics reviews dataset. The client will be able to use this tool to analyse the sentiment of unlabelled textual data about their products and hence, be able to make better decisions about their product."
